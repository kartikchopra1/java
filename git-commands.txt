git config
Sets configuration values for your user name, email, gpg key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats and more. 

git init
Initializes a git repository – creates the initial .git directory in a new or in an existing project. Example:

git init 
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/username/GIT/.git/

git clone
Creates a GIT repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch 
from it again and push to it if you have permissions.

git clone
 
git add
Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. 

git add .

git rm
Removes files from your index and your working directory so they will not be tracked. 

git rm filename

git commit
Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch 
to point to that new commit. 

git commit -m ‘committing added changes’

git commit -a -m ‘committing all changes, equals to git add and git commit’

git status
Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list out files that are 
untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not yet updated in your index), 
and staged (added to your index and ready for committing). 

git status
 
# On branch master #
# Initial commit #
# Untracked files: #
# (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) #
 
git branch -a * master remotes/origin/master

git merge
Merges one or more branches into your current branch and automatically creates a new commit if there are no conflicts.

Resets your index and working directory to the state of your last commit. 

git pull
Fetches the files from the remote repository and merges it with your local one. 

git push
Pushes all the modified local objects to the remote repository and advances its branches. Example:

git remote
Shows all the remote versions of your repository. 

git log
Shows a listing of commits on a branch including the corresponding details. 
git log commit

git diff
